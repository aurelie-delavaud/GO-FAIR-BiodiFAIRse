Biodiversity oriented GO FAIR Implementation Network

## Topic
BiodiFAIRse IN plan to build a Biodiversity FAIR virtual research environment template and develop tools, collectively bringing partners expertise to FAIR compliance by adapting data exchange standards, promoting the use and mapping of controlled vocabularies and collaborating in the development of registries gathering FAIR research objects and processes, analysis tools, and scalable workflows.

## IN contact persons: 
- Anne-Sophie Archambeau
- Yvan Le Bras

## Areas of progress and achievements in 2019
Biodiversity communities state-of-the-art -> gather informations about
	- data/metadata standards and mapping on Ecology field: Darwin core, EML, ISO19115, O&M
	- Data & metadata portals: Living atlases, Metacat, DEIMS, GeoNetwork
	- Existing workflow-oriented initiatives: Taverna, Galaxy, WPS GIS webservices, Kepler
Collaborative and workflows-oriented online platform for data access and analysis â€“ European Galaxy for ecology https://ecology.usegalaxy.eu/

### Indirect potential outputs
Enhance Ecological Metadata Language specifications
- Propose new types of data entities ?
  - genomics ?
  - media (sounds, images, videos)
- Linking eml-software to software collaborative management systems
Enhance useability of (Galaxy) tools and workflows by non-profesional scientists (citizen, middle school students, NGOs, protected areas managers, policy makers)
